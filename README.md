# Inspiration Board: Back-end Layer

This scaffold includes the following:

## `app/__init__.py`

This file configures the app. It's where:

We expect developers to modify this file by:

- Replacing the database connection string
- Importing all models
- Registering all blueprints

Note that `create_app` also uses CORS. There is no extra action needed to be done with CORS.

## `app/routes.py`

We expect endpoints to be defined here.

The file already imports:

- `Blueprint`
- `request`
- `jsonify`
- `make_response`
- `db`

Feel free to alter these import statements.

This file also has a comment to define a Blueprint. Feel free to delete it.

## `app/models` Directory

This project already includes `app/models/board.py` and `app/models/card.py`, to anticipate the models `Board` and `Card`.

Both files already import `db`, for convenience!

## `requirements.txt`

This file lists the dependencies we anticipate are needed for the project.


Coworking Contract

Access needs: larger text preferred

How you prefer to receive feedback:
- Selene: direct with examples works best as I may be oblivious of hints
- Sophia: direct feedback! please be gentle and kind :3
- Lyuda: direct feedback is good

One communication skill you want to improve on with this experience:
- Selene: When someone works on something on their own, either debugging or solving, explain to others how it was  achieved.
- Sophia: Speaking up and vocalizing opinions I might have
- Lyuda: talking about code (in a way that makes sense)

Ground Rules:
- if someone works on something alone, catch everyone else up with steps/specifics of the process; add summary to mochinut channel
- announce when pushing edits in mochinut channel

A Task System: trello for smaller similar tasks

Unmet Expectations: play it by ear, time boxing
